# EMG (EEG)

## Introduction

There are so many resources available to make one's own EMG (Electromyography) or EEG (Electroencephalography). 

This is a record of an EMG (rather than EEG at this point, due to the sensitivity issue) based on the online references that I found in spring of 2020. The references are listed at the bottom of this page.
